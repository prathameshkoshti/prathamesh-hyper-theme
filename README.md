# prathamesh's hyper theme

a theme for hyper console

---

I created this theme just for fun.

### Installing

1.  Open `~/.hyper.js` config file using any code editor like VS Code, Sublime, etc.
2.  Add `prathamesh-hyper-theme` to the `plugins` array as shown below:

          plugins: [
              "prathamesh-hyper-theme",
          ]

3.  And that's it!

### Font Family

I'm using Fira Code for console's font.

### How it looks?

Take allok at the console
